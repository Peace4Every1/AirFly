# AirFly
Website's front-end of a fictional airline company.

**The project is marked as a _CSS_ project, because of Bootstrap dependencies.**

Because of a stupid bug on my pc at the development time, I couldn't use the bootstrap grid system, so I improvised.

## To run the application:
1. **Clone this repository** - `git clone https://github.com/Peace4Every1/AirFly`
2. **Simply open** - `index.html`
